# electron-dl

> Simplified file downloads for your [Electron](https://electronjs.org) app

## Why?

- One function call instead of having to manually implement a lot of [boilerplate](index.js).
- Saves the file to the users Downloads directory instead of prompting.
- Bounces the Downloads directory in the dock when done. *(macOS)*
- Handles multiple downloads.
- Support for `BrowserWindow` and `BrowserView`.
- Shows badge count *(macOS & Linux only)* and download progress. Example on macOS:

## Install

```
$ npm install electron-dl
```

Requires Electron 7 or later.

## Usage

### Register it for all windows

This is probably what you want for your app.

```js
const {app, BrowserWindow} = require('electron');
const electronDl = require('electron-dl');

electronDl();

let win;
(async () => {
	await app.whenReady();
	win = new BrowserWindow();
})();
```

### Use it manually

This can be useful if you need download functionality in a reusable module.

```js
const {BrowserWindow, ipcMain} = require('electron');
const {download} = require('electron-dl');

ipcMain.on('download-button', async (event, {url}) => {
 	const win = BrowserWindow.getFocusedWindow();
 	console.log(await download(win, url));
});
```

## API

It can only be used in the [main](https://electronjs.org/docs/glossary/#main-process) process.

### electronDl(options?)

### electronDl.download(window, url, options?): Promise<[DownloadItem](https://electronjs.org/docs/api/download-item)>

### window

Type: `BrowserWindow | BrowserView`

Window to register the behavior on. Alternatively, a `BrowserView` can be passed.

### url

Type: `string`

URL to download.

### options

Type: `object`

#### saveAs

Type: `boolean`\
Default: `false`

Show a `Save Asâ€¦` dialog instead of downloading immediately.

Note: Only use this option when strictly necessary. Downloading directly without a prompt is a much better user experience.

#### directory

Type: `string`\
Default: [User's downloads directory](https://electronjs.org/docs/api/app/#appgetpathname)

Directory to save the file in.

#### filename

Type: `string`\
Default: [`downloadItem.getFilename()`](https://electronjs.org/docs/api/download-item/#downloaditemgetfilename)

Name of the saved file.

This option only makes sense for `electronDl.download()`.

#### errorTitle

Type: `string`\
Default: `'Download Error'`

Title of the error dialog. Can be customized for localization.

Note: Error dialog will not be shown in `electronDl.download()`. Please handle error manually.

#### errorMessage

Type: `string`\
Default: `'The download of {filename} was interrupted'`

Message of the error dialog. `{filename}` is replaced with the name of the actual file. Can be customized for localization.

Note: Error dialog will not be shown in `electronDl.download()`. Please handle error manually.

#### onStarted

Type: `Function`

Optional callback that receives the [download item](https://electronjs.org/docs/api/download-item).
You can use this for advanced handling such as canceling the item like `item.cancel()`.

#### onProgress

Type: `Function`

Optional callback that receives an object containing information about the progress of the current download item.

```js
{
	percent: 0.1,
	transferredBytes: 100,
	totalBytes: 1000
}
```

#### onTotalProgress

Type: `Function`

Optional callback that receives an object containing information about the combined progress of all download items done within any registered window.

Each time a new download is started, the next callback will include it. The progress percentage could therefore become smaller again.
This callback provides the same data that is used for the progress bar on the app icon.

```js
{
	percent: 0.1,
	transferredBytes: 100,
	totalBytes: 1000
}
```

#### onCancel

Type: `Function`

Optional callback that receives the [download item](https://electronjs.org/docs/api/download-item) for which the download has been cancelled.

#### onCompleted

Type: `Function`

Optional callback that receives an object with information about an item that has been completed. It is called for each completed item.

```js
{
	filename: 'file.zip',
	path: '/path/file.zip',
	fileSize: 503320,
	mimeType: 'application/zip',
	url: 'https://example.com/file.zip'
}
```

#### openFolderWhenDone

Type: `boolean`\
Default: `false`

Reveal the downloaded file in the system file manager, and if possible, select the file.

#### showBadge

Type: `boolean`\
Default: `true`

Shows the file count badge on macOS/Linux dock icons when download is in progress.
